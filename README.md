# Crime-statistics-in-Victoria-2016-20
A dashboard is created on the Crime statistics in Victoria between 2016-2020. 
It was done as a part of my Data visualisation course assignment at RMIT Melbourne.
The dashboard covers the following visualisation:
1. Criminal Incidents based on type of offence.
2. Harm caused intensity.
3. Affected family members - Gender and Age-wise.
5. Criminal incidents charge status.


The dataset was sourced from the Crime Statistics Agency, Victoria.
